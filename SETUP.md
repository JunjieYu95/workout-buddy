### 3. Run Database Schema

2. Click **"New query"**
3. Open `supabase/schema.sql` in your code editor
4. **Copy ALL the contents**
5. **Paste** into the Supabase SQL Editor
6. Click **"Run"** (or press Ctrl+Enter / Cmd+Enter)
7. You should see: **"Success. No rows returned"**

### 4. Get Your API Credentials

2. Click **"API"**
3. You'll see two important values:
   - **Project URL** (starts with `https://`)
   - **anon/public key** (long string)

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

cp env.example .env.local

# Open .env.local in your editor
```

Replace the placeholder values:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_long_anon_key_here
```

**Important**: Don't use quotes around the values!

### 6. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
â–² Next.js 15.5.4 (Turbopack)
- Local:        http://localhost:3000

4. **Watch the Stone Game progress!**

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API key"
- Check that you copied the **anon/public** key, not the service_role key
- Make sure there are no spaces or quotes in `.env.local`
- Restart the dev server after changing `.env.local`

### "Relation does not exist"
- The SQL schema wasn't run properly
- Go back to Step 3 and make sure ALL the SQL was copied
- Check the SQL Editor for any error messages

### "Email not verified"
- Check your spam folder
- Wait a few minutes (emails can be delayed)
- Try resending from the Supabase Auth dashboard

### "Partner not found"
- Make sure your partner has signed up first
- Use the exact email they signed up with
- Email is case-sensitive!

### Server won't start
```bash
# Kill any hanging processes
killall node npm

# Clear cache and restart
rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache
npm run dev
```
