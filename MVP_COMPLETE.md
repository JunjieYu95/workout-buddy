## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Tables Created
- ✅ `users` - User profiles (auto-synced with auth)
- ✅ `partnerships` - Partner connections
- ✅ `workout_requests` - Workout submissions
- ✅ `stone_progress` - Game progress tracking

### Security Features
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- ✅ Users can only access their own data
- ✅ Partners can view each other's requests
- ✅ Automatic user creation trigger
- ✅ Automatic stone progress initialization

## 🚀 How to Use Your MVP

### 1. Setup (5 minutes)
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create Supabase project at supabase.com
# Run supabase/schema.sql in SQL Editor
# Copy env.example to .env.local
# Add your Supabase credentials

# Start server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test the Flow
1. **Sign up** with your email
2. **Verify email** (check inbox)
3. **Login** to dashboard
4. **Connect partner** (they must sign up first)
5. **Submit workout** request
6. **Partner approves** from /approvals page
7. **Watch stone progress** increase!

## 🎮 Game Mechanics

### Reward Formula
```
totalReward = (baseReward + consistencyBonus) × momentumMultiplier

where:
- baseReward: random(5, 15)
- consistencyBonus: min(consecutiveDays, 10)
- momentumMultiplier: 1 + (currentPosition / 1000)
```

### Penalty System
- 1 missed day: -10 units
- 2 missed days: -25 units
- 3 missed days: -50 units
- 4+ missed days: -100 units
